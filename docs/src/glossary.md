"""# Glossary"""

This glossary provides definitions and explanations for key terms and concepts used throughout the `GravityToolsLight` documentation.

"""Tempo"""
A program used for precise pulsar timing analysis. It fits a model of pulsar emission to observed times of arrival (TOAs) of pulsar pulses.

"""Tempo2"""
An advanced version of Tempo, with more features and improved algorithms for pulsar timing analysis.

"""Par File"""
A parameter file used by Tempo and Tempo2, which contains the model parameters of a pulsar.

"""Tim File"""
A file containing times of arrival (TOAs) data, which are used by Tempo and Tempo2 for model fitting.

"""EFAC"""
A parameter that scales the uncertainties of TOAs in pulsar timing, accounting for factors such as systematic errors.

"""EQUAD"""
An additive term to the TOA uncertainties, representing additional white noise.

"""Iterative Mode"""
A mode of operation in Tempo and Tempo2 where the fitting process is repeated several times to refine the pulsar model parameters.

"""Silent Mode"""
When enabled, Tempo and Tempo2 run without printing detailed output to the standard output.

"""Print Output"""
When enabled, the output of Tempo or Tempo2 is printed, which is useful for logging and debugging purposes.

"""Fit EFACs and EQUADs"""
Refers to the process of fitting EFAC and EQUAD parameters as part of the pulsar timing analysis.

"""AbstractTempoVersion"""
An abstract type in `GravityToolsLight` that defines a generic interface for different versions of Tempo.

"""Tempo Keys"""
A set of configuration flags that control the behavior of a Tempo run.

"""BasicTempoSettings"""
A structure that encapsulates the basic settings and configuration for running a Tempo analysis.

"""Parameter Sweep"""
A method used to explore the effect of varying model parameters systematically to understand their impact on the model output.

"""GeneralTempoFramework"""
The overarching structure in `GravityToolsLight` that integrates different components for comprehensive pulsar timing analysis.

"""AdaptiveRefinement"""
A technique used to selectively refine a grid in parameter space, based on the results of a function or analysis.

"""Parameter Grid"""
A systematic arrangement of parameter values used for exploring the parameter space in pulsar timing or other computational analyses.

"""GeneralPKFramework"""
A framework within `GravityToolsLight` for testing pulsar timing models against Post-Keplerian parameters.

"""DEF Gravity"""
A theoretical framework of gravity, which can be tested against pulsar timing data.

"""GeneralTempoParameter"""
A general representation of a parameter used in the Tempo analysis framework.

"""Parameter Estimation"""
The process of determining the values of parameters that best fit the observed data.
